# survival

Document a list of survival items, recommendations, and advice should we ever have to 
shelter in place for self isolation or self quarantine in future pandemics like the 
coronavirus in 2019-2020.  **God Bless the healthcare workers, Doctors, and Nurses that 
are assisting all people who are currently suffering from the coronavirus.**

This is just to start us off with a "Lessons Learned" type of advice.  Please feel free 
to add to this and add content that improves it.  I will add additional content as I 
find it and I hope you will to...

I assume the CDC and NIH have similar git repositories.  I am not trying to replicate
those and I welcome any and all links I can add for those.  I doubt, however, that we 
have ever had such a widespread pandemic that has affected so much of the world's current
population.  I welcome ALL input and this increased diversity to see what occurs.

*** Formats

I welcome all improvements but it is appreciated that we all try to submit content using
the following formats.

   4. yaml (https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html)

**PLEASE DO NOT LET YOUR LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OF FORMATTING OR INEXPERIENCE PREVENT YOU FROM 
ADDING IMPROVEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.**  I will add formatting when required and as time permits...
