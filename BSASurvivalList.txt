Personal Survival Kit
Sample Contents
Wilderness survival kits contain different items than an Emergency survival kit for the home. Items you choose to include in your kit may also need to reflect the area and time of year of your adventure.

A personal survival kit is intended to be kept on your person at all times while in the wild and opened only in emergency. In addition to the kit, you should also always have your essential tools listed below.

None of this does any good unless you have a plan and knowledge on how to use it. For example, if you don't know how to fish, the tiny fishing kit is just extra weight.
